The mystic monogram, O. E.
In that morass where you and I
But were it not immoral I
"Not in the least, assured am I!"--
"My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon it--as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
In former years thus did not I
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
At last the author!" cries Mamma.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
Tattiana
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The Larina
Verses and tears et cetera.
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Opened the portals of the tomb
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The inmate is for ever dumb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
He found them in an almanac,
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And triumphs in career erotic.
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
Above the ashes of the dead.
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
Whene'er he had an aching head;
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
All silently hung down his head.
And gently hovered o'er my head?
For patience, reader, I must plead!
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread--
Upon her brow sits wrath alone--And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read;
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread--
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
A new world was made manifest!Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Would lose his slippers or gazette.Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Grant that I err not on the road."
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
He drops his pistol silently.He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
At Larina's abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceed--
Not all will like myself proceed--
Thither in future to proceed
And cares not farther to proceed;
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Will not five centuries exceed
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
He took no more the slightest heed;
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her need--
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
By visions who was ne'er deranged
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged--
What visions then her fancy thronged--
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And long perukes hath vanished.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
Just at that time his father died,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.But now our minds are mystified
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Were you in love when you were young?"--"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And a new diadem supplied.
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
By a rich pie were occupied--
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
He conversation would have led--
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Of London life is "vulgar" called
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
As if with eider-down is filled.
And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed!_--
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led--
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And to the field of honour led;
Which might for many ages last.Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
A few of different temper deemed,
Oneguine was--so many deemed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
How soon to habits she conformed
Our paradise is no more sweet.Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Because a member I became.Once more to idleness consigned,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Inseparable they remained.
So irremissible appear?O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained--
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained;
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined;
At first for books was disinclined,
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Alarm the winter journey gave.The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
He on the conflagration frowned.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Another with cock's head appeared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
My word of honour given have I.The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A faithful model she appeared
To an assembly--she appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
For evermore had disappeared.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga; nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
And they the waters recommend.He went not--sooner was prepared
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered;
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
How like the billow I desired
His tea with rum no more desired,
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
The fated nutriment desired;
And both of dull existence tired,
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
Tattiana every day conferred
Where the first time she met with _him_.Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred;
As Saadi anciently averred--
In the recesses what hath stirred
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred;
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured;
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
Trembles at artificial shame.The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Was famous for thick-headedness.Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
The blessings of humanity.Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Oneguine was the most impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused--
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
Was with himself dissatisfied.In fact, the subject analysed,
Was he in health and void of care?--Even so! His passions soon abated,
The frolics of maidens.They sang, whilst negligently seated,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
But man of sense and probity.He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Were to analysis subjected.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected
They long at home have her expected--
His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
By Olga's hand distributed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived;
Lenski as a good match received,--
In vain was youth by us received,
Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
At an old aunt's they had arrived
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Which glowed with virginal desire.When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
For first "madame" his wants observed,
His energy and impotence.And numerous pages had preserved
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed--
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
I know there's none more amiable.But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In correspondence been allowed.
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
At prisoner's base she never played.
The deuce with my inside has played."
The drama of my youth was played.
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
All sons of mental weariness.Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized;
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid--
Remained with him the youthful maid.
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
To classicism I've homage paid,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
Bruin is marching at her back!She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Oneguine then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
What they in conversation said?--
That certain volumes she might read.Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Had rendered him an invalid;
Returning, from his ship amid
Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afield--
And thus in season the rich field
What are they? Gladly would I yield
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
And can it be? But late a child
"What can be done? She is no child!"
An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
His mother from the door doth scold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
November at the gate did stand.The morn arises foggy, cold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
"We never loved in days of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Tattiana in traditions old
An almanac but eight years old.
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Had killed me had the like been told."
Her Moscow cousin, often told
And the young ladies fortunes told,
The Great World
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
She promised Eugene, or she would
Or kiss the border of her dress.To Olga frequently he would
Of friends unceremonious would
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
Exist--that their immortal band
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Heedless of your despairing cry?Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
A weary season was at hand--
Of Africa, ancestral land,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
To agitate me in my dreams.When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
And in the bathroom did command
In times gone by thy bare command--"
Sickness more courage doth command
Of a strange night when the moon and--
The poet, modest though so grand,
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
With blessings on the ditches and
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
To see you by our fireside stand,
None the conviction could withstand
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
A passionate desire to bend
To end with him her path below.To Love all ages lowly bend,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
And thou, persistent to the end,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
Are admirable, my dear friend,
In duel having killed his friend
Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
If not, the money I will lend."
An ear to my confession lend;
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
Yet I in idleness expend
My days of life approach their end,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Assistance ever will extend,
And what will Destiny concede?"Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
But finally in wedlock bind.
But what astonished do I find
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Where thine equal shall we find?
The young proprietor we find;
Upon the opening page ye find:
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Beyond this may attempt to write_.Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
And all in snow is buried deep.The wood she enters--bear behind,--
Of dreary Russia left behind,
"Your second you have left behind!"
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Had perished a creative mind,
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind;
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?
So uncongenial to my mind,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound--
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found--
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
(This by command; for it was found,
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
And her upon the threshold laid.Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Whilst struggling for the heritage.Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Then handed her the song with grace.Congratulations, toasts resound,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
"I with my friend intend to fight!"If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Debate commanded ample food--
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Such is the country custom good;
The gossip of their ladies fair.Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Oneguine meditative stood,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
How I have erred and felt the rod!
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
The Country DamselCanto The Third"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Nor aught confides unto the rest.Tattiana would have gladly heard
And ought he not to disregard
Your conversation cold and hard,
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
What doth she see? Around the board
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
The company deep silence guard.
He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
She enters a deserted yard--
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Epistle second, note the third,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
She deemed its outline might afford.
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a word--
Reform me both in deed and word,
Together they returned, nor word
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of late I have been quite absurd,--
No more the music thunders loud,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And never hath our language proud
Of my light paramour was proud.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Whither along them doth he pelt?Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
That girl--but he must dreaming be--
But what a nuisance it will be,
Feelings which long had ceased to be
I would desire my bride to be--
Is still condemned in love to be;
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
And this fifth canto ought to be
As lordly mansions ought to be,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Inseparable soon they be.
Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
Time will the ravages efface--
And physic bring with mournful face,
No, ever to behold your face,
I never should have seen your face
Where the first time I saw your face,--
But gazes on Oneguine's face
No more the village knows his face,
Pallid and melancholy face,
"She who with melancholy face
Depicted on your haughty face!
Oneguine--the beloved place
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
Hard by the window took her place."--
Why did you visit our poor place?
Drank to her health in the first place,
To follow you in every place,
And after them at headlong pace
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
"Warm yourself here a little space!"
At the front gates, but in brief space
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The boy was wild but full of grace.
An ancient lady full of grace.--
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
A print without the picture's grace,
Callous to all he seemed to be.Ye miracles of courtly grace,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Inheritor of all his race.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
For there he left a mournful trace.
And my Eugene the path must trace--
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
The shining river clothed in ice;
A noted fop who gambled hard.Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
And the extent of his caprice;
And shall adopt some new caprice.
"Bring dinner now without delay!"Upon the table in a trice
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
And his strange conduct at the dance
Again in her ethereal dance?
Before him her wild game of chance.
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Meeting you in times past by chance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
His momentary loving glance
God grant that all who herein glance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Or will my melancholy glance
Upon the stage his weary glance.
The days of love and of romance!
And in her hand a French romance.
Canto the First of this romance.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
When people with long countenance
Seek the forgotten countenance
He yawns, averts his countenance,
I heard thy voice's resonance
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
A loaded pistol in his hand."Advance!"--
The hero's name too in advance,
And views amongst themselves advance
Such open-hearted innocence.
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Tattiana learns the intelligence--
Her amorous experience
He wanders in his indolence;
And natural benevolence,
And aimless journeys did commence--
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Habit would bring indifference.
I yield with a low reverence;
To friendship making no pretence,
I cannot tell on what pretence--
But this adventure's consequence
I, after so much eloquence,
Not to behave as he did once--
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
It may be that his martyred shade
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
As in a thicket's humble shade,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
Was the first question Olga made,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Or better,--like a faithful wife.I was for calm existence made,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
Though late, have a beginning made.
As to a worthy man and good!But sad is the reflection made,
But no reply unto her made.
For our amusement ever made
Nor further comment that night made.
Whose heart experience icy made
A certain little escapade
They shovel silver with a spade,
The goddess would a masquerade
Choosing a profitable trade,
Were I like you a bard by trade--
But cannot anyhow evade
For ever faithful will abide."
His fate shall presently decide.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
But I am now another's bride--
Like Leonora did she ride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
She leisurely away doth ride,
"He promised here this day to ride,"
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Unto the windmill he must ride
On horseback every day they ride--
Mute glances interchanged aside
In consultation stand aside--
But now all doubt was set aside,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
And soon Oneguine's door beside
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
A pair of bullets--nought beside--
And hastened to his uncle's side,
Yes, happy--though she at his side
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
But grown familiar side by side
Found them in darkness side by side,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
Jaws are at work. On every side
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Always together, eventide
Meet punishment for him provide.
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
And death before the husband wide
And the saloon threw open wide;
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Of a most mournful episode,
To foreign lands he would allude,
And unto whom we all allude
Deep in the distant province rude,
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Secure in rural quietude--
Then, then--well, in some solitude
Before whom once in solitude,
Where long time he in solitude
Daily of love in solitude.
In worldly din or solitude
Before he eighteen years attained.Since Eugene in that solitude
Fly frequent to my solitude,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Measured with great exactitude.
Displayed a noble rectitude--
My scholar without aptitude
The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
To part in amity with thee!
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
By Providence's dark decree!
Tender and elevated, free?
When shall I wing my passage free
From such digressions wholly free.
Impressed him in the least degree,--
Perchance he will to all the three.
Yet sometimes pages two or three
His valet brings him letters three.
Tome of "Malvina," and but three
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Virgins miraculous I see,
Know that thy face that day I see.
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
The house and garden I would see."
And a guitar produced we see,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
The giddy world at last shall see.
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
He usually was glad to see
"Olinka is her junior, see.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.The break of day she doth not see,
The letter is the thing, you see,--
A mansion--by the window, see!
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
To move in fashionable life,
He in the early years of life
Who floats contentedly through life,
Commence a new career in life
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
In many things had changed his life--
He knew not how to spend his life.
Should be respected throughout life
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
And leads a solitary life?
So be it! But internal strife
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Of error and the passions' strife.
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Wherein the miserable wife
By children and by faithful wife
That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Without profession, business, wife,
But now ridiculous a bit.Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But at a later, sterile age,
In boston and the game of age,
And testy gamesters do engage
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Another could her heart engage,
A visionary personage
As once, to fill the rapid page
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Or faults of grammar on its page--
With humble prose I'll fill my page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Another could her woe assuage
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
To vary for a few brief days.For two whole days it seemed a change
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Placed at the customary range;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.No one the contrary will urge,
Again a century should scourge
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
That girl whom once on a time he
For empty sound the rascal swore he
A paragon of virtue he!
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Three mortal hours per diem he
Tania well nigh expired when he
And by a sweet delusion he
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And in her native language she
And a half rubles down gave she;
Nor on the letter yet hath she
"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And disappear in space; then she
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
And an encouragement did breathe
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
Men love no more, as only the
On Sundays by yon window he,
Dressed like a London dandy he
Before you agonized to die--
And silently I here must die--
The family of children hie.
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Unknown to all, without a tie,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The fever of the blood to slake--
Her promptings unto law did make,
I the same admonition make.
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Acquaintance instantly to make.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
For law I _far niente_ take
My sportive Muse I used to take
And every morning I awake
To burn, yet reason keep awake
Or any trifle else ye like
Pedantic although scholar like,
Of the horizon she is like!"--
"The post hath kept him, it is like."
By computation) it is like
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
The comrade of your youth should strike,
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Then suddenly discharge a joke
A bogy conjured up in joke,
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followed--a light broke--
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little tale--
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Approach, approach; I am thine own."Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
The ball in all its splendour shone.I tried when I began this tale,,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
And loves you as--a relative!Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile--
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile;
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
About the rain and flax and cattle."--
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.
But will not modify a tittle--
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
In solid, unpretentious style,
And a romance in ancient style
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
The door flew open--Olga came,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
"And is it long since back he came?
Will he pursue?--But no one came.
By "belle Tattiana" to replace.Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came--
Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
But turn we once more to our dame.
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
By recklessness amuse or shame
Believe me, of my present shame
That vicious set whom I don't blame--
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By love's inevitable flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatred's flame
Lost in the hamlet far away.And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
The old Derjavine noticed me,
His character attracted me.
And fled afar--she followed me.
Of many an economic scheme;
And my romance's open theme
And then the stanzas of my theme
Who reads his visionary theme
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
And, inspiration firing me,
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Transported to our Russian clime.
And visit many a foreign clime,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
For a protracted space of time.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
It now to investigate is time,
Which falls in starry flakes below.How in the country pass this time?
By time
And may fall headlong any time.
You will not all abandon me.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Though to the Academy I come
Across her youth a shade had come,
Tiresome unto her hath become
All dark and silent hath become;
Callous to all on earth become--
And shorter had the days become.
Straight from their province had he come?"--
I am in love, my hour hath come!
When will my hour of freedom come!
In winter time would often come.
Nor shall the caterpillar come
At eventide would hither come,
He wakes--they with a letter come--
Triumphant with the answer come.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
His name: the tenderness of home
Yes! for our unpretending home,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
No longer through her former home;
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
With his own pawn alas! his rook!Homeward returning, he at home
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
With better half as cumbersome;
That first the Muse appeared to me.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Mournful is thine approach to me,
But I--what is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!""Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"--
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Open the window--sit by me."
In the lone garden and the lane?
Oft staring through the window pane
Undeviating and insane
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
The PoetCanto The SecondThe village wherein yawned Eugene
Tattiana motionless abides.The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
."My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
All this was novel to Eugene.
He was in error; for Eugene
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light."And is it," meditates Eugene.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
She rose--departed. But Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Between myself and my Eugene,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
As a poetic life serene,
And irrigate them with champagne;
Are turned upon her. All combine
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
The master always used to sit."Departed Lenski here to dine
Behold the dames who once were fine
A single being: 'twas in fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
And make a dark existence shine
The lamps illuminating shine;
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"--
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
"Aline!"
Diminishes as years decline.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
With many a snare their pathway line!
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
No other than Oneguine mine.
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Of modern Russians the disease.Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
In your young days and also mine),
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Never upon my heroine
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Give me just half a glass of wine--
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
With loud explosion, the bright wine
The sum of my existence gone
All to the grand saloon are gone--
To pass the night at home hath gone.
Can she have been a moment gone
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
That hero, though his merit shone,
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Having for money's sake alone
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Of all the guests within his mind.Certainly not Eugene alone
When, sitting by his fire alone
'Twas these he read and these alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
In horror for itself alone,
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his coming--his alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Though around honoured Priam's throne
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
Said something in an undertone
She murmurs in an undertone
That like a friendly voice its tone
But that the eyes of every one
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
But send your grandson before long."No answer all that day was borne.
A constant harping on one tune,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Of fashionable dames the foe,
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
The aged woman in her woe:
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Or quietly partake our woe.
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Had bid her sigh for without hope--
In country solitude you mope,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Albums magnificent which scare
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare
O Men, how very like ye are
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
I cannot help it I declare,
And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candles' glare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
If cleverly or not I prate.But, O ye tomes without compare,
Than one's own fascinating self.Here I remark all poets are
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Which in the elevated sphere
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
"Abandon hope for ever here!"
"He's here! Eugene is here!
And Eugene soon discovered there
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
With all their progeny were there,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
By liberties or loose or light.And yet the city's flower was there,
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
And lo! he is already there!
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talon's, where
Faces which we meet everywhere
And be not in advance severe.
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
And spouted it with lyric fire--
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,--
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
With our Oneguine doth aspire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
So ardently did I desire
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire;
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
But Lenski, having no desire
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire;
The wit of others to acquire.
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
And shut him in a lonely nook.He read as vainly as before,
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
How oft to the Crimean shore
To help her to the other shore
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
And thy protection I implore.
Society renounced once more.
With it may be a couple more;
With affectation,--nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Rooted unto the spot remained.As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore;
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For long--for ever. To be sure
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
And after Albion's proud lyre
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,--
That a friend's arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The damsel under escort place."Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease;
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
In motley and amusing chase.
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Not even a poetic phrase,
I say without poetic phrase,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Address to you one single phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Who every gesture, every phrase
Eugene would speak regarding these.
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bit--they scandalise--
Crushing and a confusing noise;
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
The Larinas were since sunrise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise--
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Man--forty years long in this wise--
But now a question in this wise
Or else ,
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close--
"Command me, darling, what you choose"--
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse--
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
Am I to go through the whole list?""How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
All visited him at first, of course;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse--
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now for the first time I my Muse
By other thoughts be occupied.But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
But look you--ah! do not refuse."
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use--
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
"What can be drearier than the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
Even as Moscow, city proud.Confess, O ye who this peruse,
My spirit with such pangs before.Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I married--now, I supplicate--
    Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Both were expectant of the hate
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
"He hath neglected us of late."--
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
Lessons to give he understood!How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate;
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate--
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
'Tis fearful to anticipate
For evermore is separate.
The Larinas would celebrate,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate;
You in the least commiserate
Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
His double sashes and his grate,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
By rank as settled by the State.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Rescue me from oblivion.Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats; the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state;
God knows! The very trace is lost.'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate--
The Fete
They have invited you this week.""Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--With unanimity complete,
With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
The fervid poet would recite,
When poets lachrymose recite
Was certainly not erudite
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
A bottle of a vintage white
Winter resigned her empire white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Highways all Russia will unite
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
Nor even tears afford respite,
I have endured without respite.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
A philosophic anchorite:
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
But I must add to what I write
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
And irritates the appetite.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
By Olga stood, dejected quite
A Russian household simple quite,
Affection how did you requite?
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
The vestibule finds empty quite--
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Fond declarations they invite
On innocent delights I dote,
I on my chosen hero dote;
On balls I madly used to dote,
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
With "vale" finish off a note;
Or the delivery of a note.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
To purest love he tuned his note
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
When in simplicity ye wrote
And an elegiac poem wrote.
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
So let us to the ball-room haste,
And the attendants called in haste.
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
We must admit but little taste
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
And she despite herself would waste
And ease and fashionable waste,--
And education runs to waste,
This anchorite amid his waste
And exclamations interlaced."Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
And the cast-iron statuette
In the beginning, cold and mute,
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My country's honour and repute
None could a trace of that impute,
Her all in all did constitute;
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
He racked his brains to find its clue
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
His vanity first let us pique
Thou also, my ideal true,
Ah! it may be, affection true
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
No novelty--is it not true?--
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
I did not please you. Why pursue
He called upon me Christmas Eve--
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Without the faintest trace to leave
And all without her husband's leave.
But now our hero we must leave
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
Into delicious bondage gave
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
But promise of our meeting gave,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
The prejudices all men have,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
My heroine, Tattiana dear.Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Charming with grave simplicity.He sang of love--to love a slave.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A prudent man like you and brave
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
My guardian angel to the grave.
For him an honourable grave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But where Melpomene doth rave
The moderns of the ancients rave--
The Lord deliver her and save!
And thy inebriating wave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
But my Oneguine the whole eve
To mention the foregoing eve,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
To standards in which we believe?
These are your relatives, believe:
Just at a moment which I grieve
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
To jest as he had done last eve,
I love you--to what end deceive?--
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
And that too often we receive
What I by relatives conceive?
"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To me he would his Olga give,
Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
Time without me will lessons give,
But I await thee: scarce alive
The most industrious man alive
Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
So meantime let him joyous live
Depart in peace and friendly live?
And our successors soon shall drive
Mutual destruction to contrive.
And yet he in your cause would strive
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
What boots it with the age to strive?
Applause, the people's donative.
I can't translate the adjective.
There our Katenine did revive
My heart with but one look revive;
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
None, be my witness Heaven above!
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
And enmity and hope and love--
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The all-entrancing joys of love--
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
By absence who hath chilled his love,
I love you with a brother's love,
With tears which secret sufferers love--
The malady of hopeless love
This lot in life with stern decree?"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Maidens before her meekly move
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
If Olga smilingly approve,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Polite demeanour to preserve,
To strike imagination serve.
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Striking the intellect with awe
And supper. In the country we
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
When the hour came to bid good-bye--
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The cynosure of every eye.
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On everything around her gaze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Tattiana gently led them there.And long her eyes as through a haze
Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
No, never in the early blaze
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Nor the first snow of winter seize
The hero we immortalize.
Who now could fail to recognize
Confront thy fated torturer!Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
The calm existence which I prize
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Having lost all in life we prize.
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
They made him feel inclined to doze;
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And honestly 'tis my belief
Is ever ready with relief,
This great discovery relief
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.Habit alleviates the grief
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
With deeper woe than others' grief.
Our union would produce but grief.
                    Dmitrieff
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
    Griboyedoff
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
The family of Kharlikoff,
But stop! I will present thee, if
To write of any other elf
Then dressed himself...
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Even beneath her parents' roof
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The language of her girlish pleading
Page after page continued reading,
However, Tania's letter reading,
Whom you in slumber may have seen."But she, her sister never heeding,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Espy him approaching,
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Basins and jugs--well! everything
Also one Viazemski, remarking
And an old gent the poet marking
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But why are your cheeks whitening?"
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
The world is ever altering!
And chattering loud sit down to dine.Ceased for a space all chattering.
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Or, parable more flattering,
Amidst successes flattering
To our Tattiana conquering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
In life domestic see a string
That I forget not whom I sing.
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
At last my father gave his blessing,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Follow up love--a secret meeting
To happiness contributing.
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Metreless verses recognizing
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The days which to your youth belong?
Glittered in a perspective long,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
And grant success to labour long;
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
The nightingale there all night long,
"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
Terpsichore alone among
And thus he never fell among
And wild festivities among
And oft at eventide a throng
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?He quits the fashionable throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
With little knowledge and that wrong
Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
She brought with her the gift of song.
With dance and with song.
And led me off to church with song."
Either with him or thee in song,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
A double force unto their song
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Let me explain that in my song
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Enough! my pack is now unslung--
Since I beheld Eugene and young
"I celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Without disgust we look upon?Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
His harp beneath that sky had rung
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
The native Russian tongue impeach?
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
How meekly then I heard you preach--
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Alas! with merited reproach.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
But ultimately doth approach.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Attentive listened to his speech,
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
But home his body to despatch
With gay design and silken stitch.
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
I formerly admired her much
No coquetry was there, I vouch--
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Society endures not such!
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
With great delight.--O God on high!
"I call to witness God on high--"
Sails her allotted course on high,
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
When separation's hour drew nigh,
A sportsman who in covert lies.But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Heaved an involuntary sigh
There is no wreath upon the bough:
In scenes like these it may be though,
How dark the night is getting though!
His breast was riddled through and through,
And the eternal lorgnette through
To guess how you the eve pull through."--
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their compliments--but oh!
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Above the humble urn of death.
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Who early died a gallant death_,"
When motionless your gaze beneath
"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
You o'er your wine insulted hath--
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Or even overcome by wrath
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
But memory like a serpent's tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
He salutary rules poured forth?
"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
By the fine silver of the north.
For him were but of little worth,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
The last poor obol I was worth--
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Where youth ?
Restrained the impulses of youth;
To the impressions of our youth,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
Found the ideal of my youth,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
            Baratynski
O my Svetlana.'--Joukovski
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
His wadded coat and cap with peak;
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
To listen to the words you speak,
Vows matrimonial to break,
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
And the sagacious Triquet back
Himself transformed into a hack;
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
And he had made her heart beat quick!
He loved the simpleton to mock,
The artful prisoner should seek
And thus secures the prey we seek.
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
At times, if only once a week,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
And then a cup of coffee drank,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Till out of breath upon a seatShe sank.--
He's a freemason, so we think.
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
Into accounts would sometimes look,
But somehow there shone in his look
How bright and tender was his look,
To flight before her radiant look,
Calling to mind your icy look
The little solitary nook
His course unto the running brook.
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
And flowed harmoniously. He took
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
How thoroughly her part she took!
To ask her name the trouble took.
And clad in airy costume took
An honourable course ye took,
Jealousy and vexation took
Caught him and by the collar took
Till absently Vladimir took
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
A simple tombstone hath been set.There, when the rains of spring we mark
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
Assemblies oligarchical
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
And female tears hysterical,
Already he grew phthisical.
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Economy political,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
When the mazurka used to peal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
For promises her feet reveal
Outlandish and provincial,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Nought of its charms original
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to glory's goal.
And others rise ephemeral!
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
A ball in Peter's capital,
In one thing really did excel.
When first upon my cheek I feel
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
To such--delightful to repel.
Though of romance therein I fail
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
With eye precise and without fail.
In time I'll give ye without fail
Winter's approach she doth not hail
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
God grant I meet not at a ball
Another tribune of the ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
The rigour of cold pride and all
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
A whisper runs along the hall,
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Some future ignoramus shall
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
For long he had endured them all.
Nor years of separation all
Bedding is laid out and to all
Indifferent he became to all,
A white and undulating pall
Came forth in all her magic sheen.The snow descends and buries all,
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Hung like a print against the wall,
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
To take this letter to O-- Well!
Long in this fashionable cell
For consecrate to me he fell
The lady's glance upon him fell--
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Repentance wields not now her spell
Of languor and of love did tell
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
And crossed with trembling hand the maid."I am in love," her whispers tell
I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
But lo! the friends to chat commence."How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
At thirty who was married well,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Ennui can in the country dwell
And think: here lies who loved me well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
And wished to say to him farewell.
And rest from bygone days of strife.But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
"The family are all quite well--
Are all your relatives quite well?
How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
His relative and friend as well.
And gallicisms I love as well
And sometimes into snares as well
This separated us as well--
Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
At twenty who was prig or swell,
"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Oneguine acted very well
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
My unpretending page shall fill,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
The pervert world with icy chill
And wisely gallops to the hill.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
To listen to the rippling rill.
A garden by a shining rill.
"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
An hour passed by--another--till,
His heart reciprocated still
The coach before a house stood still.
Domestic life attracts me still,
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
You fall in love again. But still--
Time was, the poet's tender quill
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
To stay the maid against her will.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Perchance they laurels also cull--
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
In order due the maidens pull;
You know that I am now a fool--
At eighteen not to play the fool!
He was a dear delightful fool--
He used to hate--and was no fool--
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Conventionality's dull tool--
Learn to possess more self-control.
"Monsieur l'Abbe" a starving Gaul,
A shape half cat and half a crane.Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Of your perfections in my soul,
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
And a boy handed round the cream.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
But Tania just as in a dream
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Eugene at first began to dream,
The story of his young love's dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
A wish from place to place to roam,
Back to his regiment must roam.
'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
And a malicious epigram
And love's delicious diadem
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
Merciful God, what will he deem?"
Providence otherwise may deem--
Of priceless value all things seem
With mute appeal to ask they seem--
He hath acquired the world's esteem
But, as he never opened them,
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Is ever ready to proclaim
With such a perversity proclaim.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
In winter by its blank and dim
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alley's twilight dim
Of what not, and of distant dim,
But could not. Then she questioned him:--
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Its driver seated on the rim
From first to last page to the rim.
He sang of separation grim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
A country damsel's album trim,
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
In some a willing martyrdom.
And lonely through the forest creeps.""Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
She waited for--I don't know whom!
Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
The forests in mysterious gloom
This is my master's sitting-room.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
"Had he been long here, and where from?
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monster's arm,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poem's mechanism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
He "Benedetta" used to hum,
He had excepted from the ban:
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Romances three, in which ye scan
'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
Oneguine slowly then began
Interrogation to denote.And my Tattiana now began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
To write in cantos twenty-five.I've thought well o'er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
"How came you then to wed a man?"--
Vladimir's property, a man
At last became a ruined man.
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Let me present ye to the man,
He was an honest gentleman,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Portrayed contemporary man
Eugene directs the trusty man
Four deadly paces do they span;
I feel, allotted is my span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
In her friends' albums, time had been,
There friends of pure delight had been
Assuredly should not have been
Its passions and its modes of thought.The butt of scandal having been,
Had a deluded victim been
A fond and careful mother been.
A substitute for lamps we hail!Obedient she had ever been
And fields my joys have ever been;
Which never have existed, e'en
Become a faithful wife and e'en
"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
Repose from labour, satire keen,
What a storm of emotions keen
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
In springtime on the meadows green,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
To this arrangement can be seen,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
The torment born of crime unseen,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before him red roast beef is seen
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"But nothing changed in them is seen,
In little maidens of thirteen?
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.His malady, whose cause I ween
Writ in my honour now and then--
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
His friendship I acquired just then;
The cold reply with gloomy mien
Approach not to hearken
The tale of these romantic men;
To pass with reasonable men
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
Amid submissive herds of men
Whom, as the custom is of men,
With taffety instead of crape.Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
The poet fell; already men
Yawning betook him to a pen.
I know that Parny's tender pen
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
The imagination to enliven
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
By sympathy I have been driven.
The memory of the bard was driven
Oneguine was a citizen
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
How bitterly he would malign,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
And viewed the door with cunning eye.All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
At times talk nonsense with design;
But boldly I myself resign:
My heart's allegiance can resign,
Men opposite. The cross they sign
My gratitude do not disdain,
To crush me with a just disdain.
Listen to me without disdain.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Should dearly like a dance again.
Shall I behold thee once again?"--
But to the garden once again
The youthful lover once again
Oneguine, bored to death again,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
Oneguine--take him up again--
That until Christmas comes again
Of love again, and yet again;
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And agitate my heart again;
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
By an avowal just as plain.
He there is master--that is plain;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Can lower depths beyond remain?
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
And an habitual sense of pain;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
I know not if his heart felt pain
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
After the wedded couple strain;
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.
I loved you--what did I obtain?
Tania the meaning would obtain
A case of books he doth obtain--
My light productions to retain,
Although her book did not contain
The household property contain:
His daughter's book to ascertain
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
And distance interposed in vain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
He reads at random, reads in vain.
And far removed from rumour vain;
I've wasted in amusements vain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
To raise a clamour and a din:
In solitude or worldly din,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Ere conversation could begin,
But by degrees the crowd begin
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
With words of foreign origin
The pall of night was growing thin,
At morn an icy bath within
He heard his soul's complaint within,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Pardon I ask for such a sin--
Until her powers of running fail.She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
In books he saw nought to condemn
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
A canine face with horns thereon,
And that unrivalled paragon,
And gossip of the town and fashion
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
Behold! the world's opinion!
Recent instructions of its mother.But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
The natural fickleness of passion,
The youthful poet's fond confession.
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
Oneguine went with trepidation
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
And tears of reconciliation:
Must now my stanzas occupy.Tattiana was her appellation.
Although it will not bear translation,
The God of Love is after you!A coquette loves by calculation,
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Not high in general estimation;
Enhances love in estimation
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Invigorate imagination
Long time her young imagination
Original imagination,
She did not think "procrastination
Of foreign whims the impersonation--
Triumphant by anticipation,
Their Jealousy and separation
The fair of the next generation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
And eye which gleams with inspiration--
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
The poet's fervid conversation
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
Without constraint in conversation
Not knowing its interpretation,
Alone within his habitation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
And buried deep in meditation,
As formerly much agitation.
And long internal agitation
And marking Tania's agitation,
A love which knew no limitation,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Thy meditative incantation--
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
By what idea or observation
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
My very latest composition!
And a determined disposition,
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Beneath the silver of the moon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
Well! just as she was yesterday."Why did you leave last night so soon?"
Submissive as if in a swoon,
His wife was also mad upon
Our fathers used to dote upon;
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His spirit was intent upon.
Still for ever fare thee well.'--Byron
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The counsel good and full of reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
To visit Moscow in the season.
The works of Mr. Richardson.She was thus fond of Richardson
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Or that adoring Grandison
Was certainly no Grandison.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
Sailed silently in unison--
There an imperious skeleton;
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To write his forefathers to warn
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
A jolly song and distant horn;
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Perchance you also soon may burn,
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Do we alone our losses mourn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Delighted glances in return;
Have entered never to return.
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Then to some gallant in your turn
Men will forget me, but my urn
A load of care upon the maid."But lo! forth from the valleys dun
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
In silence shall I sit and yawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And on the footstool sitting down
And the fair sex as light as down!
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
I feel thou wast by God sent down
The aged nurse in ample gown,
In a half-open dressing-gown
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
The opportunity is flown.
For summer to the country flown,
Upon my visions such intrude.Fresh aspirations I have known,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For o'er a word to fashion known,
And bitter torment never known.
What everybody long has known;
He is not there: I am not known:
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
And town and friends forgotten quite.This northern summer of our own,
When will the devil take his own!"
Impelled to union with his own
Far from his Italy--his own.
And the young damsel from the town,
Troy's sages should in concert own
He left _you_ first, and I must own
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
But tell me what am I to do?
Familiar to him long ago.
Made me so tipsy long ago!
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
They hand in hand to table go.
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
Whither that evening he will go.
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
"And is it she? It must be--no--
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
But would not look at Cicero.
Inspired him with disgust and so
"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?And so my noon hath come! If so,
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Or a professor in tulle cap.
The lady in the crimson cap
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
He's a straightforward little chap."
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
With iridescent wing doth flap
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Buried in meditation deep,
Long time in meditation deep
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
The maids beside Tattiana keep--
Her path across the plain doth keep--
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Are oft deceptive--like their feet.Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Like down from Aeolus's lip,
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
The sudden rattling of a car.
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Since in these arms I thee did bear--
All are constrained and fetters bear,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.To the assembly her they bear.
From everything the heart held dear
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
I can't conceive a little dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear--
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear--
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
To be in conversation clear
There is a spot the village near
With sad refrain misfortune near.
And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
He daily in his drives drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Do me a favour and appear.
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Never for me to reappear--
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
But as to fighting--'twill appear!
Two dressed in uniform appear--
Doth in us or our names appear,
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
The shining orbs of night appear;
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
And happy unto you appear.
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
But word for word his letter read.All is foreseen. My secret drear
He bending whispered in her ear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
The simple epitaph--a tear
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
For us, may be for many a year.
Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
And from the Millionaya afar
And grown more curious by far
Unhappily too salt by far;
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
And to revive Tattiana seemed.The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
As in the timid forest deer,
And exclamations and good cheer.
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Gliding in negligent career,
Amid the company career.
"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
To lawless love I should prefer--
"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Romance of love I pray refer,
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
Adroitly seized and carried her;
And like a shadow haunted her.
"The younger, you're in love with her!"
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Unfavourable unto her.
He leisurely adorns for her.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
To Eve the universal mother,
Gravely repeating to another
Aye bids ye in some way or other--
But finally grew bored by her.
Servant of God and brigadier,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
Together we have wandered o'er
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Malicious and a slanderer.
And courtier, fop, and usurer
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
This was his social character.
What is his latest character?
Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
I'm beaten in another matter;
Where better?
Appear; along the road of Tver
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
At Russ she was by no means clever
'Fare thee well, and if for ever,
Hope with her fascinating power
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fair--
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Pray is it not a tough affair
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Rural LifeCanto The FourthThe less we love a lady fair
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
But with confused and bashful air,
Finally tost his arms in air
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Around the carriage of the pair--
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
He knows Kaverine will repair.
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Urging your droshkies swift as air
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Mark ye with what a modest air
Flies past the porter to the stair,
'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
But gray Phillippevna the door
She cannot--Eugene oped the door
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Anicia soon appears, the door
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Lest the malicious reader or
Is petted by the Emperor?--
Some one or other editor
Opens unto her visitor.
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
And sermon--but in that dread hour
Impressionable for an hour,
I blame not your behaviour--
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Pelagie Nikolavna has
And devastate the woods around.There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
In this case quite mistaken was.
Still of his club he member was--
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
His wife approaches, with him leads
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
That crass stupidity misleads,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
She the delicious novel reads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
And all that from thy hand proceeds--
"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
To bring behind: the triple steeds
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
His son and mortgages his lands.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
Where each young critic ready stands,
With bated breath, around she bends
At times my reason almost bends,
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Tattiana from the hill descends
Then glittering in the sun descends.
No one my anguish comprehends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
A maiden's secrets--of the heart.Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
Against my inclination, friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Their harmless conversation blends
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
His hate by slander, and who spends
And care but little for its ends.
On us beyond the grave attends,
O feet, where'er your path extends
With love which happiness extends;
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And wild among them grew her words--
At least their accents and their words
Of passion reminiscences,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
My goddesses, where are your shades?
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
The remnant destiny concedes,
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
And supercilious dames she glides,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides--
Of migratory gipsy hordes--
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
May be that I by heaven's decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
A due which must to earth be paid.The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
An inn at every stage erect.But now, what wretched roads one sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
And all thy precious elegies,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Where all upon the surface lies,--
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Look through the window and kill flies.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Tattiana to the index flies
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
When the same life before him lies
What more's required? The world replies,
Ever to hear the same replies
All breathless and without replies.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
Had come both friends and enemies--
His friends and also enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
The general who accompanies.
To bear love's parching agonies--
Thrice happy who their agonies
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Oh! who her speechless agonies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
She from the winter corn espies
Some a mazurka occupies,
He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the world's mortal revelries,
And pelt him with cherries,
With raspberries, cherries.
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
My splendid house and gaieties--
From public and from private ties,
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
At neighbouring hospitalities.
And fashion's gay frivolities;
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of life's vanities,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
He now a full possession takes,
Without grammatical mistakes.
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
His recent glory he invokes.
Also, to equalise the scales,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
She got a book of nursery tales,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
To banish far unworthy themes
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And due precautions take betimes.
Which we experienced long ago.Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
And the young revellers of past times
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Longer the East inert reclines
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Wherein love innocently pines.
The golden ember now enshrines,
And fashionable magazines,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
And now he views forgotten foes,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Into the tangled garden goes
All vanished as an echo goes.
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The accents wild of other's woes,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
He fixedly upon her stares--
She calm and unconcerned appears.The husband comes and interferes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Imagination's sacred fires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
As with innumerable fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And now his youthful heart desires
And of the irksome harness tires,
Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
In true interpretation hates:
And slowly life coagulates--
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
A victim decked with golden leaves;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He long should have been on the road.He rings in haste; in haste arrives
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
She the acquaintances she loves,
To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
And now she skips and now she springs
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The time between the wolf and dogs--
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Thine honour is my countersign!Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Calmly her eyes encounter his--
Eugene, more tolerant than this
And deem the world perfection is!
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
I just hint, in parenthesis,
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
As your light footprints on the green.Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
The very morning of our days.He who hath lived and living, thinks,
A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But now--my very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails;
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
When the sonorous Breguet tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And the heart's agitated dreams.
For rural solitude and dreams,
'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
And more imagination teems.
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aims--
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
The secrets of maidens.
Device of rural minds acute!)Young maidens, fair maidens,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Insensible her hand remains
His kneeling posture he retains--
To secrets of virgins,
Friends and companions,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
The olden time shall be my theme.Old people's simple conversations
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Latest arrivals' salutations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
Take to their wings and fly away.But to Oneguine! _A propos!_
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
I will not wed, and ever weeps
And dream of life's delightful dawn?The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
The two friends' compliments she hears
Feeling in others much esteemed.With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
(So 'twas with us in former years,
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
In the world's vortex my success,
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess--
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oft--this I myself confess--
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
"If the domestic hearth could bless--
Me your perfections would not bless;
Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
To loiter there in idleness
The happiest days of life employ?Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess;
He _cannot_ give me happiness."
"'Twas possible then, happiness--
"But strange am I to happiness;
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
Their slander e'en was weariness;
In old age life is weariness!"
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
But Eugene long hath left the press
A young Armida's lips to press,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
To fawn upon and love express;
"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express--
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
Love's tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
Tattiana's letter I possess,
A strong resemblance these possess--
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
The uncontaminated kiss
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Even amusing fools we miss
I've had to make for having friends!But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss--
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
With cherries, red currants,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
But, after mutual compliments,
The epistle from the bard presents.
She visited the humble tents
Again the plague of boyhood--love?The hours once more Oneguine counts,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Ever receive with kindly hearts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
The Paris of those country parts
Deliberate approach of guests
Variety of speech and vests,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And like Napoleons each of us
The stomach doth admonish us.
A million bipeds reckons thus
Corneille's majestic genius,
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
A critic of the stage malicious,
A slave of actresses capricious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
Oh! who is not calumnious?
There Didelot became glorious,
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.She seemed of him oblivious,
By such allusions scandalous,
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
And glittering simpletons beside;Amid sly, pusillanimous
The drive becomes monotonous--
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Beyond the city-barriers haste.Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
It was a cheery, generous
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Abandon cities riotous,
Well! Larina appears to us
Come sing we in chorus
Who labours hard to humour us?
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
The friend of liberty and laws
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
His watch, the sun in turn he views--
Perverse, unfavourable views?
And through the lofty windows views
To male acquaintances he bows,
The men salute with lower bows
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
Before a fire which feebly glows
And this the faithful one allows,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
For otherwise--God only knows!
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Through dense aristocratic rows
On unknown female forms he throws.
The connoisseur his glances throws
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
And I confess that now-a-days
Men become friends from idleness.But even thus not now-a-days!
Of fiery youth's untutored days
Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful days--
That vanished are my youthful days,
As the sins of my youthful days
As partner of my mournful days,
And then to meditate for days
Companion of my childhood's days.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
No more with pale Diana's rays,
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Oneguine his excuses says;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
Unto Anicia for the keys
The household troop of little boys,
A joyous troop of little boys
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheat--
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
And in a whisper did repeat:
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
I mean my name not to repeat."
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great;
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
Attend in male attire arrayed.On this artistical retreat
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the study's calm retreat,
A ball here, there a children's treat,
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
Begins to talk of this and that,
"No misery I see in that"--
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
Her brow she did not e'en contract
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?--
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
The disenchanted glass direct
Of the AEneid, but incorrect.
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But now--what brings you to my feet?--
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
Near Khariton's in a side street
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
Wherein I castigation get;
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
And homeward like an arrow tore.My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And we--an unattractive set--
On whom a sister's heart was set
Of every sort and every set!"--
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Or parody of modern ways?Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
"Then amongst strangers I was left--
Of consolation all bereft--
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Will to the old times faithful be.Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
But from the Muses' loftiest height
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
And hurried home his awful freight.
Philosopher just turned eighteen.China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,--
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
And also fashionable beaux.Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olga--to a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.In my young days of wild delight
E'en for an instant find delight,
"But death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
To find in gossip such delight,
In such an album with delight
They will receive us with delight."
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Would she in silence long remain.Contemplativeness, her delight,
And like the prisoner's our delight
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
Or but for fame he saw the light;
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight;
There came a sudden flash of light,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light--
And showed with an uncertain light
His care unto his pistols' plight,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Deep in the greenwood far away?Arising with the morning's light,
That the two friends with morning's light
But lo! already the moon's light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happy--as I might.
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night--
Terror of guardians of the night;
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night--
And vanish like a bird in air.Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night;
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
And gloomy epigrams malicious.How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
In the first place, say, am I right?
And better, if I judge aright;
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
As if he cruelly had joked!'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright--
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
And form a network left and right;
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
And my dark soul to light was brought;
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought--
The "in memoriam" pages sought,
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
Must take a walk and rest a bit--
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
And at the table sat her down.To tragedy, the fainting fit,
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
Oneguine could not now submit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The snow upon the streets doth melt--
E'en as the poet says he leant.
A letter for her hero meant:
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And o'er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent;
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Shines in the female firmament
With scandal's trivial ornament.
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
A timid love to banishment?--
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But now--none heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
The foes with downcast eyes abide.Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent--
"You have a letter to me sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
Into thy hands my fate I yield!No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content;
And scanned in silence its content.
So Tania to her heart's content
In course of time (the whole extent
Serve who could neither read nor write.Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
'Tis time she to the altar went!
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went;
Oneguine to the window went
The Larinas unwisely went,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font--
A forest now she sees in front
In spite of common sense we're wont
And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot--
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exile's lot;
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
To Russ indigenous are not;
Just at this moment I cannot.
One moment's slumber suffer not.
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
        Where man is not.
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart--
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart--
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Would at the proper time appear.How well he played the greenhorn's part
How soon he learnt deception's art,
By flattery and lover's art--
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
Vociferously paid her court,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
He seemed for matrimony born.He was beloved: or say at least,
Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
"I weep. And if within your breast
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
By bee and butterfly which pass.'Twas she who first within his breast
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
The fatal hour had come at last--
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.The gulf between them was so vast,
But this is my advice, 'twere best
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
No sense was ever manifest
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
Like you and me and all the rest?--
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest--
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
And thus unto her nurse did say:"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
By fond illusions once possest
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist--
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
That every morn at Verrey's cost
Whither departed is the host?
When in as instant she is lost,--
By their own horses, not the post--
And would by candlelight arise.Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about--
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt;
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!--for you
"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholy's claw
Obedient then to Nature's law,
He offers her his murderous paw;
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Russia's Terpsichore review
Incessantly his chains to break."I still a complication view,
The altar flame was quenched in night.Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew;
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
Or letters of a maiden young.And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Moscow
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show--
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?--
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
Us from the world wherein we live.Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
They sat, but conversation's flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now--
Society he duped enow."
The unaffected traits she now
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife.""So thou art wed! I did not know.
And in the morning doth not know
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now;
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Till January fell no snow--
But such is not my project now,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
And all your love on self bestow;
And linen on him doth bestow.
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
And so--God bless them, if He list.In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And what the old man might bequeath.And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jilted--glad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The ruts of his own fatherland.Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around her--it was day.
And wholly occupied his day--
Olga's admirer came that day:
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
That he was "ready any day."
She was as heedless and as gay--
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till morn--life uniform but gay,
"How often in thine arms I lay;
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay--
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
'Tis there that arrant fops display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Like D when dinner doth inspire.Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray--
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
And blest the shadows of the night."To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
She sits alone--'tis ever _she!_So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say--
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away;
Oneguine Olga bore away.
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
And to Oneguine far away
But thoughts meander far away--
But borne in spirit far away
Across the smiling face of dawn.Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
The lily's stem to eat away,
Unto her husband, went away--
With serious air then went away
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.Resolved the flirt to cast away,
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way;
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Ah! he has gone the other way"--
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
But I, in love, was mute and dull.The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Oneguine sat the table by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And like a palisade flit by.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
And  they
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.To consanguineous dinners they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey;
A lover's letter might convey,
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy;
At least by show of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
A true account and in detail.But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
"No matter, look immediately.
Took aim--but as immediately
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
I long have ceased to offend the laws.Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
"Who will be there?"--"The family.
What say you? to the family--
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
All arise. To the door he goes.Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally;
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
But of this love, e'en casually,
To all she answers cruelly--
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Though I'll return to him right early,
That all may hear his voice's tone.Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
You'll spend your winter famously!
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
"Then send your grandson quietly
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Then he'd malign them secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly;
Employ your glasses constantly,
She cannot--then impatiently
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
His son is married, just conceive!""And he--but of him presently--
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany--
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.She loved upon the balcony
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Attentive listened to the lad.But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry--
Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
And turned aside the drapery;
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Relate some ancient history."
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
That Nina's marble symmetry,
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Byron's capricious phantasy
Carried away by ecstasy,
Must bow in common courtesy;
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
And fits of coughing racked her chest.By the sick lady's gaiety
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
And husbands' tedious amity?
But grant with magnanimity
And naked uniformity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity--
Of old maids the divinity,
Whom thirty centuries adore.I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
As giddy youth's hilarity--
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
Also my wretched liberty
Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Hears not my importunity!
It carries of antiquity
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thought--retirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
